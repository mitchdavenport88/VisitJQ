# Visit JQ

### Milestone Project Two

Visit JQ is an interactive website aimed at encouraging people to venture out of central Birmingham to discover what the Jewellery Quarter has to offer. The JQ (as locals call it) is seen as a bit of a hidden gem, located just a stone’s throw away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre with a flourishing food and drink scene. This combined with the area’s industrial roots and being Birmingham’s central creative hub makes the JQ well worth a visit.

## Demo

## UX

### Strategy
The aim of the website is to create a user friendly website that’s shows potential visitors information about the Jewellery Quarter in a clear and intuitive manner. Visit JQ will provide the user with information and recommendations in order to entice people away from the city centre and support more local, independent businesses as well as this local community.

This website will be aimed at potential visitors who maybe new to the area and have never visited or even thought of visiting before. And then those who may know the area maybe have visited but are looking to visit again and explore it further. Either way the target audience share a common end goal. 

Reasons for the site:
* Aim to increase the amount of visitors by encouraging people to visit or to return.
* Provide a snapshot of the variety that the JQ has to offer - there is something for everyone!
* Be a guide to the area, giving recommendations on where to go and what to see. 
* To be informative and provide useful information.
* Promote and support local, independent businesses.
* Be a point of contact for potential visitors. This can be via social media or by a contact form on the site.

### User Stories 
As a user I'd like:
* The site to be easy to navigate around.
* To be able find what I’m after quickly.
* To get a better understanding about the area to gauge whether it’s worth visiting.
* Recommendations of what to do, where to go and where to stay.
* Find further information on recommendations easily, so I can decide on whether they’re suitable.
* To find out where places are.
* To be able to get in touch with someone if I have any questions.
* To do all of the above regardless of what device I am using.

As the site owner, I'd want:
* An easy to navigate, responsive site.
* A well-presented and visually appealing product that gives users the feeling they can trust the content.
* To give people reasons to visit. I can do this by providing a wide range of options of what to do, where to go and where to stay, catering for a wide audience.
* To show relevant information on my recommendations. This information is to be clear and informative.
* To provide useful information in a concise, intuitive manner that keeps the user engaged and likely to return.
* To be easily contactable.

### Scope - Functionality (must meet all)
* The site must be easy to navigate around.
* Present clear and concise information, which is visually appealing.
* We want the user to remain engaged throughout use so must be user-friendly.
* Function as expected:
    * Fully responsive on all devices.
    * External links must open in new windows.
    * Logo is also a link to home / landing page.

### Scope - Content (in order of priority)
* An about section / sections that tell and show the user what the JQ has to offer.
* Recommendations. Show these in a visual and interactive way using JavaScript to create clickable features that increase engagement. 
* Contact section. Messages could be sent either using EmailJS or contact can be made via social media.
* Give additional information on recommendations – websites, reviews and descriptions.
* Show a local weather forecast using a weather API as part of the about section.

### Out of content scope but for future consideration
* An about Visit JQ page - providing service and company information.
* Gallery - linked or hooked up to a Instagram account.
* Newsletter subscription built into the contact form or as a pop up modal.

### Structure
Based on the information gathered during the scope the website will require just one page, with each section filling the page horizontally and following one another vertically. The basic structure of the page will be as follows:
* Fixed navigation bar at the top with the Visit JQ logo and links to each section of the page. This will be accessible at all times.
* Body (split into four sections):
    * Home / landing page with a hero image. 
    * An about section with the tagline - Eat | Drink | Explore. 
    * What to do? This section will feature the google Maps API and will show our recommendations of what to do and where to eat and drink. 
    * Contact section will be a contact form, which will send the message via the Email.JS API.
* Footer with social media links and copyright notice.
