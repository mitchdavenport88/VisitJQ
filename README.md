# Visit JQ

### Milestone Project Two

Visit JQ is an interactive website aimed at encouraging people to venture out of central Birmingham to discover what the Jewellery Quarter has to offer. The JQ (as locals call it) is seen as a bit of a hidden gem, located just a stone’s throw away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre with a flourishing food and drink scene. This combined with the area’s industrial roots and being Birmingham’s central creative hub makes the JQ well worth a visit.

## UX

### Strategy
The aim is to create a user friendly website that shows potential visitors information about the JQ in a clear and intuitive manner. The site is aimed at two types of user, who share a common end goal:
* Those who are new to the area and have never visited before.
* Users who know the area / have visited before but are looking to explore it further.

Reasons for the site:
* Provide a guide to the area, with recommendations on where to go and what to see.
* Aim to increase the amount of visitors by encouraging people to visit or to return.
* Promote local and independent businesses.

### User Stories
As a user I'd like:
* The site to be easy to navigate around. 
* To get a better understanding about the area.
* Recommendations of what to do, where to go and where to stay if I wish. I will use this information to gauge whether it’s worth a visit or not.
* Further information on recommendations.
* To find out where places are.
* To be able to ask questions if needed.

As the site owner, I want:
* An easy to navigate site that users can use on any device.
* Information to be well presented and visually appealing.
* To give people reasons to visit. I can do this by providing a wide range of options of what to do, where to go and where to stay to cater for a wider audience.
* To show relevant information on my recommendations. This information is to be clear, informative and useful.
* To be easily contactable.
